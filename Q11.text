solution : Purpose of declaring variables in javascript

        The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a memory location for storing data values that 
        can be used throughout a program. Variables act as placeholders for data, making it easier to work with and 
        manipulate information in your code. Declaring variables allows you to:


        1. Variables can store various types of data, such as numbers, text, and objects.
        2. You can perform operations on the data stored in variables, such as calculations, 
        concatenations, and comparisons.
        3. Variables enable you to reuse values at different points in your code, reducing redundancy.
        4. Variables can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops.
